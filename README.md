# CS195-Fall24-Notebook-4
## Underwater Animal Detection

<b>Due</b>: Wednesday, November 6th, 2024

For this assignment, you'll use the Underwater Animal Detection Dataset (UWSDet_v1), which has been provided and is also available on Blackboard for the CS195 course. This is a single-class detection task, requiring you to detect the presence of an underwater animal in the image (from the following four categories: dolphins, seals, sharks, and whales) and provide the rectangular bounding box where the animal is located within the image. Your goal is to fine-tune two deep neural network-based detectors, such as Faster R-CNN and Mask R-CNN, using this dataset.

## Notebook:
You should use these two notebooks for two experiments: 
   - [_Notebook_4_starter for Faster R-CNN_](https://github.com/alimoorreza/CS195-Fall24-Notebook-4/blob/main/cs195_notebook4_faster_rcnn_starter.ipynb).
   - [_Notebook_4_starter for Mask R-CNN_](https://github.com/alimoorreza/CS195-Fall24-Notebook-4/blob/main/cs195_notebook4_mask_rcnn_starter.ipynb).

## Expectations: ☑️
You need to create a Colab notebook starting from here - [_Notebook_4_starter for Faster R-CNN_](https://github.com/alimoorreza/CS195-Fall24-Notebook-4/blob/main/cs195_notebook4_faster_rcnn_starter.ipynb). After completing the Faster R-CNN experiment, proceed to [_Notebook_4_starter for Mask R-CNN_](https://github.com/alimoorreza/CS195-Fall24-Notebook-4/blob/main/cs195_notebook4_mask_rcnn_starter.ipynb). Add your code and results to document your experiment.

📉 📊 📈 💹 You also should include **textual visualization which will be produced automatically** during fine-tuning



### Rubric:
> *This assignment is worth 10 points. It will be graded using the following rubric. I strongly suggest evaluating your project using this rubric before turning it in. It consists of two criteria: 1) *writing, and 2) *code. The details of the rubrics are as follows:
